QUICK GUIDE
================
So you want to get started?

1) Download and install the Kinect SDK v1.6 ( http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/kinectforwindows/develop/developer-downloads.aspx )
2) Run Ubi Displays
3) Follow the on-screen steps
4) Drag HTML files onto surfaces to deploy displays


INTRODUCTION
================
Ubi Displays simplifies the process of creating interactive projected displays using a projector and a Microsoft Kinect.  Using the interface it is possible to create interactive displays on almost any static, flat object: walls, floors, books, beds, etc.  

Check out the video here: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=df1NO7MoAUY

The displays themselves use HTML, CSS and JavaScript to display content.  Using the provided API, you can write JavaScript logic which can make displays appear, disappear, move, change interaction modality to suit the content (i.e. swap multi-touch for a foot detector) depending on physical factors and the kind of content it is trying to display.

Ubi Displays is a research project.  Although the hardware involved is relatively expensive at the moment (the price point often outweighs the value of the displays that can be created), researchers predict that wireless, steerable pico-projectors will soon be a commercially viable replacement for the lightbulb.  If that happens - my research aims to answer the question of: what will we do with it?  By letting everyone experiment with the technology, I hope to find out what kinds of things this technology is good at, what it is bad at, and how we can design better computer interfaces in the future. 

Any and all feedback is more than welcome!  Ideas, suggestions, interesting things you have noticed with how people react to the technology and drawbacks of the whole idea can be emailed directly to me!  Although please send bug reports to Google Code: (http://code.google.com/p/ubidisplays/issues/list).

There is also an accompanying academic paper, which you can download here: http://highwire-dtc.com/url/ubidisplayspaper
